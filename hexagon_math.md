# Derivation of Variables in a Regular Octagon from Distance `d`

Given:
- `d`: distance from the center to a vertex.

## Objective
Find the side length `s` using trigonometry and then derive `x` (half-diagonal) and `w` (diagonal).

## Process

### Step 1: Derive Side Length `s` from `d`
In a regular octagon, the central angle corresponding to one side is 360°/8 = 45°. Since `d` is the distance from the center to a vertex, we can form a right triangle by drawing a line from the center to the midpoint of one side.

The angle at the center that corresponds to one side of the octagon is 45°, and thus the angle for the right triangle is 22.5° (half of 45°).

Using trigonometry, specifically the cosine function for the angle 22.5°:
\[ \cos(22.5°) = \frac{s/2}{d} \]
\[ s = 2d \cos(22.5°) \]

### Step 2: Find Half-Diagonal `x`
Using the same right triangle:
\[ \sin(22.5°) = \frac{s/2}{d} \]
\[ x = d \sin(22.5°) \]

### Step 3: Find Full Diagonal `w`
Using the entire diagonal which spans two 45° angles (90° total):
\[ w = 2d \cos(22.5°) \]

### Conclusion
With `d` given, we can calculate `s`, `x`, and `w` for the regular octagon.

- `s`: Side length of the octagon.
- `x`: Half the length of the diagonal.
- `w`: Full length of the diagonal.

The equations provided allow us to calculate all necessary lengths based on the given distance from the center to a vertex of a regular octagon.
