To determine the key dimensions of a regular octagon, we can derive equations based on the geometric properties of right triangles and isosceles triangles formed within the octagon.

### Diagonal Length  \( d \) 

The diagonal of the octagon, denoted as \( d \), can be found by considering the right triangle \( ABC \), where \( AB \) is the width \( w \), \( BC \) is the side length \( s \), and \( AC \) is the diagonal \( d \). Using the Pythagorean theorem:

![\Large d^2 = s^2 + w^2](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.image?\dpi{200}\Large&space;d^2=s^2+w^2)

### Width  \( w \) 

The width \( w \) is the distance from one side of the octagon to the opposite side, which is the length of one side \( s \) plus twice the length of segment \( x \), the line from the midpoint of a side to the center of the octagon. Thus, \( w \) is expressed as:

![Equation w = s + 2x](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.image?\dpi{200}\Large&space;w=s+2x)

### Segment Length  \( x \) 

The segment \( x \) lies within isosceles right triangles, such as triangle \( EBD \). Since the octagon is regular, each of these triangles has two equal sides, which are the segments \( x \) and the side length \( s \). By the Pythagorean theorem:

![Equation s^2 = 2x^2](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.image?\dpi{200}\Large&space;s^2=2x^2)
![Equation x = s / √2](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.image?\dpi{200}\Large&space;x=\frac{s}{\sqrt{2}})

Substituting \( x \) into the width equation:

![Equation w = s + 2(s / √2)](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.image?\dpi{200}\Large&space;w=s+2(\frac{s}{\sqrt{2}}))
![Equation w = s(1 + √2)](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.image?\dpi{200}\Large&space;w=s(1+\sqrt{2}))

### Final Equations

Substituting \( w \) into the diagonal equation yields:

![Equation d^2 = s^2 + (s(1 + √2))^2](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.image?\dpi{200}\Large&space;d^2=s^2+(s(1+\sqrt{2}))^2)
![Equation d = s√(4 + 2√2)](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.image?\dpi{200}\Large&space;d=s\sqrt{4+2\sqrt{2}})

With these equations, we can solve for the diagonal length \( d \), width \( w \), and segment \( x \) given the side length \( s \) of a regular octagon.

- **Diagonal \( d \):** ![Equation d = s√(4 + 2√2)](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.image?\dpi{200}\Large&space;d=s\sqrt{4+2\sqrt{2}})
- **Width \( w \):** ![Equation w = s(1 + √2)](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.image?\dpi{200}\Large&space;w=s(1+\sqrt{2}))
- **Segment \( x \):** ![Equation x = s / √2](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.image?\dpi{200}\Large&space;x=\frac{s}{\sqrt{2}})
